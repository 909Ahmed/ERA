# MNIST Classification using Neural Networks

This repository contains code for training a basic neural network model on the MNIST dataset for handwritten digit classification. The project is structured as follows:

## Files

### 1. `model.py`

This file contains the definition of the neural network model used for classification. The architecture of the model is designed to take input images of size 28x28 pixels and output predictions for the digit represented in the image.

### 2. `utils.py`

`utils.py` contains utility functions necessary for data loading, preprocessing.

### 3. `S5.ipynb`

`S5.ipynb`  It includes code cells with step-by-step instructions for loading the data, defining the model, training the model, and evaluating its performance.
